# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben Dixon
I am an enthusiastic individual with a good work ethic, looking for a role that will challenge me and provide new learning opportunities. I transitioned from a successful role as the evening cleaning team leader at ISS to start an exciting career in the tech industry.
I recently completed Makers boot camp where I got the opportunity to learn various new tech skills and was also introduced to test driven development and working in an agile manner.
 When working within a team, I always adopt a friendly attitude, am open to input from others and eager to learn. I enjoy taking on new tasks which allow me to apply my problem solving and critical thinking skills to find a solution. 



# Education

## Makers Academy (sept 2023 to Jan 2024)
- In a short period of time I was able to learn Python, Kotlin, Android studio, Html, CSS, JavaScript including React, Worked on databases with SQL and Mongodb, and used jest and pytest for testing.
  
- I also got the chance to work on several group projects, allowing me to further develop my communication skills. I got used to pair programming and helped organize our projects around an agile framework.

# Work Experience
## ISS (Oct .2021 - Sept 2022) Cleaner
- I was made employee of the month twice due to my hard work and can do attitude 
- covered for the team leader during their absence, which gave a chance to work on my communication and organization skills. We were often short staffed so it was important to organize the team to prioritize certain tasks 


## ISS (Sept 2022 - Aug 2023) Team Leader
- I was responsible for training staff
- I helped implement new strategies 

# Skills
## Training
- During my time as team leader, ISS implemented POS (pure office space) this was an attempt to standardize cleaning methods across multiple contracts. As part of this process I was responsible for training all of the staff with these new methods. I went on a five day course to learn the new system and how to train people in it. This helped me further develop my communication skills by giving succinct instructions and fielding any questions. It also gave insight into the training and learning process.

## Fast independent/learner 
- I always enjoy learning new things. I taught myself to play piano over lockdown and am always learning new cooking techniques and recipes. Furthermore my learning journey at makers was largely independent, I went from knowing very little about programming to learning several languages in the space of 4 months.

## Communication
- During my time as team leader I helped implement a new cleaning strategy, this involved careful planning and communication. Through this process I gained valuable experience implementing a plan to someone else's specifications. Through makers I was able to learn the importance of clear communication in a tech environment
