- About Me

I am an enthusiastic individual with a good work ethic, looking for a role that will challenge me and provide new learning opportunities. I transitioned from a successful role as the evening cleaning team leader at ISS to start an exciting career in the tech industry
 When working within a team, I always adopt a friendly attitude, am open to input from others and eager to learn. I enjoy taking on new tasks which allow me to apply my problem solving and critical thinking skills to find a solution.

Work Experience
ISS (Oct .2021 - Sept 2022

 covered for the team leader during their absence, which gave a chance to work on my communication and organization skills. We were often short staffed so it was important to organize the team to prioritize certain tasks

Skills
Training
During my time as team leader, ISS implemented POS (pure office space) this was an attempt to standardize cleaning methods across multiple contracts. As part of this process I was responsible for training all of the staff with these new methods. I went on a five day course to learn the new system and how to train people in it. This helped me further develop my communication skills by giving succinct instructions and fielding any questions. It also gave insight into the training and learning process. 
Fast independent/learner 
I always enjoy learning new things. I taught myself to play piano over lockdown and am always learning new cooking techniques and recipes. Furthermore my learning journey at makers was largely independent, I went from knowing very little about programming to learning several languages in the space of 4 months.
